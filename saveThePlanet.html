      <h2>Single Use Plastic</h2>
      <h5>Grocery Bags, July 30, 2019</h5>
    <!-- Header <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>-->
      <img src="planet/environment4.jpg" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
      <p>It takes more than 500 years for a plastic bag to degrade in a landfill.
         Unfortunately the bags don't break down completely but instead
         photo-degrade, becoming microplastics that absorb toxins and continue to
         pollute the environment. Fish and sea turtles often mistake these bags
         for jellyfish or for food and will often eat it. This can cause terrible
         damage to our ecosystem.</p>
      <h5>Plastic Cups, July 30, 2019</h5>
      <img src="planet/environment6.jpeg" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
      <p>If you enjoy getting a coffee or iced tea every day, replace the daily
        plastic cup with a reusable cup. Starbucks uses more than 8,000 paper cups
        a minute, which adds up to more than four billion a year. It is estimated
        that by 2050, there will be more plastic cups in our ocean than fish. Starbucks
        offers a 10 cent discount on your drink if you bring your own reusable cup
        and you protect the environment at the same time.</p>
      <h5>Produce Bags, July 30, 2019</h5>
      <img src="planet/environment5.jpg" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
      <p>You can buy reusable produce bags for about $1 each. Produce bags are
       similar to plastic bags as they take hundreds of years to partially biodegrade.
       Instead of putting your fruit in a plastic bag that will be used for a
       maximum of an hour, use a reusable bag and get hundreds of uses.</p>
      <h5>Utensils and Straws, July 30, 2019</h5>
      <img src="planet/environment6.jpg" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
      <p>Straws and utensils are unlike some other single use plastics, as it can
       not be recycled at all. Plastic straws are small enough where it could be
       digested by bids, fish, or sea turtles. Although straws are not necessary,
       if you like to use straws consider using bamboo or metal straws. They are
       portable and small enough to carry it in your bag. Instead of using a plastic
      fork once and then tossing it in the trash can, you can carry around a bamboo
       or metal set/</p>

      <h2>Food</h2>
      <h5>Vegan, Sep 2, 2017</h5>
      <img src="planet/environment7.jpg" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
      <p>A vegan is an individual who does not eat any meat or animal products.
        Animal products include, but are not limited to, honey, milk, eggs, gelatin,
        and lard. There are many health and environmental benefits to being vegan,
        but you must make sure you become a vegan in a healthy manner. </p>
      <h5>Vegetarian, Sep 2, 2017</h5>
      <img src="planet/vegetarian.jpeg" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
      <p>A vegetarian is an individual who does not eat any meat but can eat animal
        products. There are some vegetarians who eat fish while others do not.
        Being vegetarian can reduce your carbon footprint.</p>

      <h2>Transportation</h2>
      <h5>Bike, Sep 2, 2017</h5>
      <img src="planet/bike.jpeg" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
      <p>Biking is environmentally friendly as it can reduce emission pollution
        and noise pollution. A bike does not require gasoline, therefore having
        zero to no emission pollution. It also does not require any of liquids
        such as antifreeze that can be harmful to the environment.</p>
      <h5>Bus, Sep 2, 2017</h5>
      <img src="planet/environment8.jpeg" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
      <p>According to the National Express Transit, “Buses emit 20% less carbon
        monoxide, 10% as much hydrocarbons, and 75% as much nitrogen oxides per
        passenger mile than an automobile with a single occupant.” Public
        transportation is more eco-friendly than driving a car as it can carry
        more people at a time. </p>
      <h5>Train, Sep 2, 2017</h5>
<img src="planet/metra.jpeg" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
      <p>If possible, take the train to work instead of driving. Not only will
        you save money that you would have spent on parking, but it lowers
        carbon emissions. Trains also use less energy per mile than a car would.</p>

      <p>Protect Vulnerable Wildlife from Extinction!</p>
      <img src="planet/extinct.png" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
<p>“Wildlife is in big trouble. Last month, hundreds of international experts released a devastating report: As many as a million species of plants and animals are in danger of extinction, some within the next decade.”

<p>Protect the Ocean from the Threat of Offshore Drilling</p>
<img src="planet/drilling.jpg" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
<p>“The Trump oil and gas plan has suffered a major setback. Instead of forging ahead with a new five-year offshore oil and gas plan that aimed to open up almost all of America's coastline to risky offshore drilling—the new Secretary of the Interior, David Bernhardt, announced this plan would be delayed indefinitely.
While this is very good news—we need to stay vigilant!
Let's use this time to build support for Congressional action that will protect important and sensitive ocean areas.”

<p>In the United Kingdom, Farmers Can Legally Feed Their Animals Plastic</p>
<img src="planet/pig.jpg" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
<p>The United Kingdom mad cow scare is long over but if today's cattle knew what their farmers were feeding them you would have some pretty bitter bovine.
That's because in the U.K. up to 0.15% of plastic is allowed to go into feed for animals destined for human consumption.
As the Guardian reports: "More than 650,000 tonnes of unused food, from loaves of bread to Mars bars, are saved from landfill each year in the UK by being turned into animal feed." This food is often still packaged when it goes through the recycling process as it is turned into animal feed. And because the machinery used to strip the unwanted food from its plastic wrapping isn't able to separate 100% of the plastic, the Food Standards Agency permits feed to contain a part of the material.

      <h5>Bills, Sep 2, 2017</h5>
      <img src="planet/vote.jpeg" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
      <p>H.R.2349 - Climate Change Education Act</p>
<p>Introduced in House (04/22/2019)
Climate Change Education Act</p>
<p>This bill declares that the evidence for human-induced climate change is overwhelming and undeniable.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) must establish a Climate Change Education Program to
increase the climate literacy of the United States by broadening the understanding of human-induced climate change, including possible consequences and potential solutions;
apply the latest scientific and technological discoveries to provide learning opportunities to people of all ages; and
help people understand and promote implementation of new technologies, programs, and incentives related to climate change, climate adaptation and mitigation, and climate resilience.
NOAA must also establish a grant program for climate change education.

      <h5>What You Can Recycle, Sep 2, 2017</h5>

      <p>
        Plastic, bottles, containers, cardboard boxes, phone books, magazines, tin, aluminum, steel cans, glass

      <p>Styrofoam, bubble wrap, cords, grocery bags, batteries, pizza boxes, cleaning products, scrap woods
</p>
      <h5>Clothing, Sep 2, 2017</h5>
      <img src="planet/forever21.png" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
      <p>Don’t buy clothing from fast fashion stores such as Forever 21, H&M, and
         FashionNova! These are fast fashion stores that produce low quality pieces
          in a quick time span in order to sell them to their customers. They are
          made to only last a short time and have to be replaced quickly. In producing
          clothing quickly, it adds to water pollution and environmental destruction.</p>
