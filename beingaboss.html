  <h1>Tips For Being A Boss<h1>
  <h2>1. Know Your Worth<h2>
   Dress to impress yourself. Make sure to walk in the room confident with your head lifted high in the air.
  You don’t want your crown to fall. Wearing appropriate attire that is sophisticated and
  comfortable will make you feel more confident. By wearing a jumpsuit, jacket, blazer over jeans can make your outfit
  look even more trailblazing.<p>

  <h2>2. Don’t be afraid to speak up<h2>
    <p>We often think that we should not disagree with anyone because it will make us stand out from the norm.
       That is exactly what we should do as women. Because if we never disagree, then we can never express our opinion. Being a boss means being fearless and asking questions,
      and allowing yourself to speak and to listen to others as well.
