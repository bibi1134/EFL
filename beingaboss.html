  <h1>Tips For Being A Boss<h1>
  <h2>1. Know Your Worth<h2>
   Dress to impress yourself. Make sure to walk in the room confident with your head lifted high in the air.
  You don’t want your crown to fall. Wearing appropriate attire that is sophisticated and
  comfortable will make you feel more confident. By wearing a jumpsuit, jacket, blazer over jeans can make your outfit
  look even more trailblazing.<p>



    <br>


  <h2>2. Don’t be afraid to speak up<h2>
    <p>We often think that we should not disagree with anyone because it will make us stand out from the norm.
      That is exactly what we should do as women. Because if we never disagree, then we can never express our opinion.
      Being a boss means being fearless and asking questions, and allowing yourself to speak and to listen to others as well.

  <h2>3. Don’t let people talk over you<h2>
    <p>We have all been there either presntating or saying our opinion. And an older male usually in a dismissive tone,
      gives an opinion about why you are wrong, without letting you finish the thought.
      We all know that we do not tolerate this bullying tactic. So as bosses, we should not allow this to happen and speak up.<p>

  <h2>4. Dream Big<h2>
    <p>It is very important to dream big and know that dreams do come true.
      But it's your responsibility to owe your dream.
      And being able to plan and dream ideas,
      then going and making your dreams come true.<p>


    <br>

    <h2>5. Don’t be afraid to be assertive<h2>
      <p>Its okay not to be warm and fuzzy, when being a boss. It's good to have a strong manner and be goal oriented when speaking to others.
        To let them know that you are serious and ready to attack the planned goal.<P>
